    <h4>What are these graphs?</h4>

    <p>These graphs are sampled periodically from our own internal metrics about the performance and availability of GitHub services. Theyâ€™re accurate to within a few minutes.</p>

    <p>We provide a GitHub Site Status API for consuming this information. If you're a service that integrates with GitHub, you can use these JSON responses to populate your own status dashboard.</p>
